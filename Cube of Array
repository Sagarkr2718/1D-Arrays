Problem Description
You are provided with an integer array A. Return another array B of size same as that of A such that B[i] = A[i]3 for 1 <= i <= |A| (1 based indexing).

public class Solution {
    public long[] solve(int[] A) {
        long [] B = new long[A.length];
        for(int i=0 ; i<B.length; i++){
            B[i]=A[i]*A[i]*A[i];
        }
        return B;
    }
}
